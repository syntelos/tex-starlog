Takver rolled over and went to sleep.  She was exhausted.  A welcome feeling she and Shevek had long ago grown semi-addicted to.  Satisfaction.  She knew that Shevek had forgotten that he had given her keys to everything in all of his systems.  And that she used those keys regularly to watch and interact his subconscious at work.  She didn't understand why he didn't use her keys to do the same.  She didn't care, or thought it was funny, that she had played invisible roles on his work since his visualization work.  It kept her warm at night to be as close to him.  It didn't matter how.
