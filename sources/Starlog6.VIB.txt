Takver felt Shevek at his work station and was lifted from her bed.  She rolled over the bag and packed it into its locker over head.  She could feel his force diving into his debugging, which was completely different from a real output mode.  It was a faucet that had only the slightest flow.  


She went to the midsection food production machine and made herself a coffee.  In space it was served in a pouch with a drinking straw at one end.  It was just as good because someone, somewhere, had perfected the pouch to not affect the experience adversely.  Thank you, brother, whoever you are, where ever you are, may your day be as rich as this moment.


She flew to her desk and opened the tabletop to look down on her latest project, Shevek's computer project.  She thought she understood the problem it had, and took a look at what Shevek was doing at the moment.  He was looking at the electrical wave differential from the interaction point to the amplifier that fed the analog compiler.  No news, there.  He's just warming up, rereading yesterday's work.


She lit to the air and landed inverted on the floor of the ceiling, hovering over her midsection garden.  It was perfectly healthy and required no manual assistance.  She breathed in deeply the fresh green oxygen, like turning on the bedroom lights in the morning.
