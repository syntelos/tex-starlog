Shevek's display still had the carbon bonding interaction testing a molecular assembly for differential analysis.  The analog image was fuzzy, fermionic waves against black shadows of spatial resolution colored in golden hues of pink and blue.  Two dimensional overlays of derived metainformation showed the analog info-mathematics.  Molecular analog information space lived in a microcosm that included digitisation and fabrication hardware.  These interfaced digital and analog subsystems for communication and storage.  The balance between analog and digital subsystems met utility to purpose with dimensional completeness.  Designed and constructed by a community of users, it was nothing more than a good tool.
