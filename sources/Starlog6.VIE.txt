Takver was in her fingers as she laid her hands on the software pipeline for the differential analyzer.  The interaction point was a silver atom adjacent to one of the molecules under test, a hydroxyl.  She watched the simulation restart as she nearly wished it so.  A photon with infrared energy hit the cloud and shook the hydrogen bond.  The wave was absorbed by the sensor and traveled across a mono chain into a feed field that moved another hydrogen within the differential target software system.  Success.
