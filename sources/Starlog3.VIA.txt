The next morning, home time, Shevek was four days behind Takver.  It had been more than a year since he had seen her.  Her observatory flight was a reboot.  She and Shevek had seen each other almost every day their whole lives.  When she finally told him he could come, he asked her to come home.  She had not said why he should go to the moon, only that he could.  Long ago their language resolved to pick up where and when it can, and no sooner.  


They had agreed that their relationship was best described as entanglement.  They were inseparable in this sense.  Spiritually.  The theories of Synchrony and Simultaneity described spirituality as dimensions of love having temporal functions.  The mechanics were no mystery to Shevek and Takver.  These theories described their experience well.
