Shevek woke, as usual, with a chest full of emotions.  He found his bag wrapped tightly around himself, which was a surprise because he didn't like that -- sleeping in a tight bed.  He left it out and got himself through the air to the midsection where he would eat.  He made a coffee, and sipped it slowly through a straw.  His mind registered the coffee.  His heart registered Takver sleeping.
