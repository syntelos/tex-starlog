The molefab products were natural computers.  Molecular devices a thousand or a million times more dense than former microprocessor technologies implemented myriad functions logical and mechanical.  The character of cubic carbon was extremely convenient to technological freedom.  It possessed many advantages to previous engineering materials.  It could be applied to structural, mechanical and electromagnetic purposes with extreme performance.  It was applied everywhere.  It afforded lighter than air facility to space planes, and massively parallel space-time computing.
