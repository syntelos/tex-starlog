Digital solid state information was stored on hydrogen proton in the binary code of an electron.  These bits were held in a sensor - manipulator cell within a carbon lattice.  They were addressed in a physiological three dimensional cell location.  The analog software pipeline record of the differential analyzer was a copy that could be destructively read into copy machine and duplicated by the tool chain.
