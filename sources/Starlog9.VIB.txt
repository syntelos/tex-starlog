Takver grabbed Shevek from his rest.  Shevek felt the flow of water through his heart and went to his work station.  Takver was there, in a design schematic for a cylindrical volume measuring a kilometer in diameter and length.  The structure was silicon, not carbon, and was simple and heavy looking in its details.  A horizon marked the lunar surface at half the length.  The walls were a meter thick and opaque.  Takver.  “For the community”.
Shevek.  “We leave behind a fab bot and collect and sort the details from home”.  He watched Takver dive into lunar materials, so he put together a bot bus.  A minimum and a maximum for the gross dimension.  A launch plan.  Airlock grabs maximal diameter.  A descent is easy if crashing at high velocity is ok.  Maximal impact force, minimal impact velocity.  “Wow, that works”.  “We can crash it into a mountain”.  “Weird”.
