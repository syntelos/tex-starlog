“Did you read the news?”  Takver.  “No”.  “People died”.  “How?” “Someone blew a big dam in an area disputed as native”.  “What are we going to do?”. “The violence against humanity group is talking about it”.  Takver sent the URL on his work station console.  Shevek plugged it into his browser and read the statement prepared by Ruggiero and Clarke.
