Shevek found Takver on a space tether.  He ran the airlock build program and reviewed his suit.  He would follow her into space rather than apply the new differential analyzer to his work station.  He would also need a walkway from his zenith to his nadir, and around to Takver’s nadir.  Something he could pull on.  He looked through Sagittarius files and found a plan and program.  The program would fabricate and deploy a tether from his zenith to Takver's nadir.  He would snap a ring to it and walk himself around.  He checked the budget against the flight scenario.  It was already counted.  Takver had counted the airlock and a set of tethers.
