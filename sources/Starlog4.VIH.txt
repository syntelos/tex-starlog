Takver had been the first to publish the solar cycler path to orbit as a space plane NAV routine.  It had been her first flight, a vacation of ten days.  Sagittarius afforded a transparent fuselage to the spectacular views.  Shevek could have been told to come, but he didn't share her passion for space flight.  The experience would be better alone.  She worked on her data stream network interfaces and published data and photos and notes to her public namespace on the internet.  She had hoped that Shevek would share her interest.  She knew it would soak in eventually.
