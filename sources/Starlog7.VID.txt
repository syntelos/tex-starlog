Takver turned the floor semi-transparent to have a look at the stowed mating adapter.  It was also translucent, and presented a familiar ripple in a small part of the area between her and the planetoid.  She would think again about an interior extension that would permit a space walk.  She darkened the chamber and took up her work.  The design she had would hold one person, sitting, and require three hours depressurization for the suit that Wagner designed.  It was a part of her original design for Sagittarius.  Because she had a space -- interior space -- problem, she had decided that she would build it and destroy it when she would use it.  She would have Takver, soon.  It was time.


She ran the fabrication program.  The loss of resources weighed heavily as she elected to have her cake and eat it too.  She would have Takver here a minimal amount of time, and took his and the mated stations’ expected flight path to where she wanted to go.  A slow dip below her ideal orbit.  And while outside in the stars.
