Sagittarius employed a mating coupler that had been designed and published as the international standard.  Every human ship and craft that originated from earth employed the identical design to enable rescue and aid -- to not prevent it -- in the void of space.
Sagittarius had two, amidships, at the nadir and zenith.  The mating program configured the two craft for the deployment operation.  It would take some time.  The optical link was continuous, having an uninterrupted line of sight.  The mating program shared a keychain that was private to Shevek and Takver.  It's integrity module would generate an infinite keypad for a simple digital encryption they called foam.  


Digital communications employed error correcting codes and store and forward packet delivery networks on the common bus for IPN systems.  Digital packet architecture bounded the comm link requirements with respect to method and bandwidth.  The mating program was designed to share the one link needed between the craft, the IPN link.  The internetworking architecture maximizes the application of the resource that is most useful -- for a bidirectional definition of the term application, both in to and out of link hardware and distribution.  


Between the two Sagittarians, the mating program had configured Takver under Shevek’s nadir.  Takver had the view of the planetoid, and Shevek had deep space over his observatory.  It then commenced the opening of mechanical hatches that served as a protective, aerodynamic shell.  The two stage airlock could not contain a person, but served the role of permitting the mating hardware to move.  It extended in a two stage pipe roughly a meter in diameter and half a meter from the aerodynamic surface.
