Shevek's contributions to space time computing included a novel data processing architecture for visualization.  Coupled to an analog display, a space time simulation could be slowed to display the process.  Naturally, this was a boon to productivity.  The research community adopted and adapted the idea.  Students fell in love with the obvious allure of a distant future dropped into their laps.  Takver and Shevek were in the vanguard of developments understood by proficients of quantum physics.  The world was only very slowly waking to the new technology which would change human existence.
