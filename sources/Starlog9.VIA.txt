Shevek's view of the lunar surface filled his senses.  It was cold by night and hot by day -- either of which would kill the unprepared.  He folded himself into a seated position and felt is heart beat.  He felt Takver with him, there, on that surface.  She wanted to meet in space, and she wanted to talk about the surface.


Without an atmosphere, the space plane had no access to the lunar surface.  It could not ascend from that altitude in the gravity well.


Shevek considered this.  If Takver wanted to descend, they would be talking about how and why.  The how was a problem, like any other, that may may not have an applicable solution.  The why concerned him.  Takver's presence was not small.  He found a place to wait for her.
