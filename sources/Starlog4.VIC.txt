Takver had named the space plane “Sagittarius”.  It was a dense complex of electro-mechanical devices fit into a winged haack body.  A simple atmospheric mode of flight.  It had twelve crystalline rings that could be brought online within the power collection and storage subsystem.  Schematically, the fusion rings multiplied the power available from the sun's radiation by the power available in proton storage.  Environmental proton was continuously collected, but most human endeavors shot the heavy products of the crystalline beam rings into space.
