Takver and Shevek knew that comprehension required an input to meet an output.  Speaking without comprehension was a relatively desperate act.  Of the two, Shevek was the more impatient.  He believed more strongly that comprehension could be lifted from words.  The female, in contrast to the male, knew that comprehension was a temporal relation to the processes of the body and mind.  It was more true for the female than the male, but only by evidence.  The couple had no need for nesting themselves.  The need of each other was satisfied differently in each moment, and the male tended to language more frequently.  Takver’s grip on her outputs expressed worlds.  Shevek was coupled to those worlds.
