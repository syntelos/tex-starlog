The capillary pump concept featured broadly in molefab products.  In the walls of the space time computer, capillary devices were sized to a target molecule.  At each end a mechanical hatch and an electromagnetic ion field.  The wall between the electrodynamic field and the environment maintained a hard vacuum.  It's array would shoot ambient molecules and free electrons and into the external environment.  


The electrodynamic field was a volume of planes supported by structural gridding and integrated with fabrication facilities.  The whole or part could be grounded and reconfigured or rebuilt.  It was analog and digital subsystems which -- ideally -- came to life in the intended feature set.
